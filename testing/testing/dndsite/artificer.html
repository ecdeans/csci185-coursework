<p>Channel your inner mad scientist or Tony Stark! Artificers are those who spend most of their free time creating all sorts of artifacts, weapons and more. This class shines when played by imaginative players, as it requires you to describe your spells as being “cast” or applied by tiny tools or creations. Playing this makes you the brain of the group, the problem solver, as well as the weird strategist that infuses recordings in mundane objects and creates magical ones.</p>
